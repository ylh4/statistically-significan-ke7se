# **App Name**: Statistically Significant

## Core Features:

- Dynamic Input Form: Interactive form for users to input sample size, significance level, category names, counts, and select a reference category.  Includes inline validation to ensure the sum of category counts equals the total sample size and that the significance level is within the valid range.
- Results Table: A table to display the calculated disparity results for each category, including p_i, p_ref, Î´, SE, z, CI_low, CI_high, and a boolean indicating statistical significance.
- CSV Export: Functionality to export the results table as a CSV file, allowing users to download the data for further analysis or record-keeping.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A clean white (#FFFFFF) or light gray (#F0F0F0) to provide a neutral background.
- Secondary color: A calming light blue (#ADD8E6) for headers and labels to improve readability.
- Accent: Use a vibrant teal (#008080) for the calculate button and interactive elements to draw attention.
- Ensure a clear, tabular layout for the results, using defined borders to separate columns and rows.
- Use simple, recognizable icons for actions like 'reset' and 'export' to enhance usability.
